jHmtl is a jQuery plugin for parsing jHtml.

jHtml uses the json format as markup.  

```javascript
 [
  "div",
    {"class":"holder"},[
      "p",{"id":"example"},"hello"
    ]
 ]
```	
jHtml is based on a set of three.

1: String which represents the tag name
2: Object which specifies the attributes of the tag ex. (class,id,src...)
3: Array which represents the innerHtml of the element ex. (child nodes,text..)

jHtml helps you write one page applications. It allows you to write your markup in a proven data exchange format, and lets you avoid having to write logic for the logic-less parts of your page.  

jHtml also comes with a modified micro templating
