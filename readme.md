jHmtl is a jQuery templateing language plugin that uses the json format as markup.  

```javascript
{
	"h1" : {
		"class" : "greeting",
		"content" : "Hello World"
	}
}
```	

jHtml helps you write one page applications. It allows you to write your markup in a proven data exchange format, and lets you avoid having to write logic for the logic-less parts of your page.
