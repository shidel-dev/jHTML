jHmtl is a jQuery templateing language plugin that uses the json format as markup.  

	{
		"h1" : {
			"class" : "greeting",
			"content" : "Hello World"
		}
	}

jHtml helps you write one page applications. It allows you to write your markup in a proven data exchange format, and lets you avoid having to write logic for the logicless parts of your page.
