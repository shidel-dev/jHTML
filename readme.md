jHmtl is a jQuery templateing language plugin that uses the json format as markup.  

{\n
	"h1" : {\n
		"class" : "greeting",\n
		"content" : "Hello World"\n
	}\n
}

jHtml helps you write one page applications. It allows you to write your markup in a proven data exchange format, and lets you avoid having to write logic for the logicless parts of your page.
